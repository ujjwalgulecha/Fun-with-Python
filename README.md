Web Scraping using python
my first try at it
using it to extract results from thegradcafe.com to find out number of admits and rejects from UCSD

Steps to use my script (Currently only for Ubuntu):
DO THIS ONLY ONE TIME
$ mkdir pycon-scraper
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install requests beautifulsoup4

After the above is done, download my codes

Then change to the directory where the above are installed
$source venv/bin/activate
$python ucsd_try.py 

See the results
